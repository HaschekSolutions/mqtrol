# MQTrol

Is a simple MQTT based agent/web interface solution for automating sysadmin stuff.

You can manage all clients running the agent via web interface directly over MQTT

# Installing the Agent

1. Install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Go to the agent folder from a command prompt and run `npm install mqtt`
3. Open the file `/agent/install-service.bat` so the NSSM dialogue will appear
4. Use the following settings
  - Application tab
    - Path: Path to your node.exe
    - Startup Directory: Full path to your agent folder (doesn't need the rest of the project folders, just `/agent`)
    - Arguments: Full path to your agent.js file
  - Details tab (just fill in some name and desciption)
  - Log on
    - Ideally you'd use the Administrator account here
